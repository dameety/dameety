👨‍💻 I am a full-stack developer with over 6 years of professional experience building reliable and scalable web applications. 🏗️🏡

I work confidently across both backend and frontend stacks using **Laravel**, **PHP**, **Vue.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **REST APIs** and modern **CI/CD** workflows. ⚙️

I have delivered production platforms including **ecommerce applications**, **construction project-management tools**, and **high-traffic SaaS apps**. My work spans backend architecture, API design, UI implementation, performance improvements, and troubleshooting complex issues. 🧩

I enjoy solving challenging problems, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and turning requirements into clean, maintainable software that users and businesses rely on every day. 🚀
